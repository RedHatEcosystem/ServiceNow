# ServiceNow
Setup for using Ansible and ServiceNow with bidirectional communication -- for service catalog items to launch AAP2 job templates


# Installing Ansible Spoke to your ServiceNow instance.  
Red Hat TPP instances should already have IntegrationHub Enterprise installed.  IntegrationHub Enterprise or Professional are prerequisites for Ansible Spoke.  If the next step doesn't work, contact your admin about getting one of the higher level IntegrationHub packages installed to your ServiceNow instance.
